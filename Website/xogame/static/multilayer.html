    Cyan Circuit is a perceptron with a hidden layer in between the two layers of nodes. He has 27 inputs, 9 outputs and
    300 hidden nodes, he has 2 weight matrices 1st with 27 rows and 300 columns, 2nd with 300 rows and 9 columns. The
    activation function for the 1st weight matrix is rectified linear. The Rectified Linear activation function makes
    outputs of the weight matrix that are less than 0 equal to 0 and outputs that are more than 0 unchanged. The
    activation function for the 2nd weight matrix is Linear meaning that the output vector is unchanged. He uses the
    dataset of 1000 games provided by Midnight Spark for training. His training algorithm is Layered-Learning.
    Layered-Learning is when each layer is trained separately a lot with Backpropagation repeatedly except for the front
    layer which is trained with Gradient Descent. The front layer was trained 1000 times separately on the Strategy
    Training Dataset and then the back layer was trained 1000 times as well. This was repeated 5 times.
