            In May 1997 the AI Deep Blue bet the reigning world chess champion Garry Kasparov 3-2. In March 2016 the AI
            Deep Mind bet the greatest Go player in the world Lee Sedol 4-1. NOW September 2016 we take the next big
            leap to beat the ticktacktoe champion!

            There are 2 main kinds of AI, Symbolic AI, and Connectionist AI. Symbolic AI are made with ifs , elses and
            other logic statements.
            Connectionist AI are made up of lots of information holders (called neurons) and have connections with
            each other. Each connection has a weight and that weight determines the likelihood of using the next
            neuron.
            Connectionist AIs are so amazing that they can do things that they haven't been programmed to do!
