<p>Feed-Forward Neural Network (perceptron) which has two layers of nodes, 27 inputs and 9 outputs, and one layer of weights, 27 rows by 9 columns, it also has an activation function called Rectified Linear. This has used Supervised learning with the learning algorithm of gradient descent to learn to play tic tac toe. Gradient Descent works by finding the direction that each weight is currently headed in, to do this it uses calculus to find the gradient, and how far away it is from the global minima, to find this it takes the error vector by comparing the calculated output vector and the goal output vector. It then makes a delta weight by multiplying the error and gradient together, it then multiplies that with a learning rate to make sure it doesnâ€™t overshoot and pass the global minima. It was trained on the Strategy Training Dataset using Gradient Descent for 1000 generations.
