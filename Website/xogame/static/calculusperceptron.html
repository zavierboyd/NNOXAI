    Cyber Sapphire is a Feed-Forward Neural Network (perceptron) which has two layers of nodes, 27 inputs and 9 outputs,
    and one layer of weights, 27 rows by 9 columns, she also has an activation function called Rectified Linear. She has
    used Supervised learning with the learning algorithm of gradient descent to learn to play tic tac toe. Gradient
    Descent works by finding the direction that each weight is currently headed in, to do this she uses calculus to find
    the gradient, and how far away she is from the global minima, to find this she takes the error vector by comparing
    the calculated output vector and the goal output vector. She then makes a delta weight by multiplying the error and
    gradient together, she then multiplies that with a learning rate to make sure she doesnâ€™t overshoot and pass the
    global minima. She was trained on the Midnight Spark Training using Gradient Descent for 1000 generations.
