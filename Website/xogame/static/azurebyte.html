    Azure Byte has used Reinforcement Learning to learn to play tic-tac-toe. Tic-tac-toe Reinforcement Learning works by
    Azure Byte playing against different pon-AIs. Throughout the game Azure Byte keeps a record of the boards he's seen
    and moves he made. After the game has finished Azure Byte gets a score 1 if it won 0 if it drew and -1 if it lost.
    He then goes through the boards and moves he's made and changes the score of the move according to the score of the
    game as a result of those moves. When he next encounters that board he will try to pick the move with the highest
    score. He was first trained 2000 times against Bitzy Doo playing ‘X’ and then 2000 more playing ‘O’. Both training
    sessions with a multiplier of 0.2 . He was then trained 100000 times against Midnight Spark with a multiplier of 0.2
    , the next 100000 times with a multiplier of 1, and the last 100000 times with a multiplier of 5, all playing ‘X’.
    this is repeated but instead of playing ‘X’ he plays ‘O’.
